# This is a heading

Note that headings are created with 'number signs' and the 
level of the heading is indicated with the number of 'number
signs'

## This is a subheading

This is a bullet list:

  - item number 1 
  - item number 2
  
and this is a numbered list:

  1. first time
  1. second item (it doesn't matter what number you use in the source code.)
    1. a sub list with 2 additional spaces of indentation
    3. second sub list item
  1. back to the main list
  
and now for an 'r chunk'
```{r}
head(cars)
dim(cars)
plot(dist ~ speed, cars)
```

and we are back to rmarkdown code after the 'r chunk'.
